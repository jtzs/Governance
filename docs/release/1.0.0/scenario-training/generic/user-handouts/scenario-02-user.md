# Scenario 2 User: Office Entry

**Role**: Ex-Staff Tailgating

**Background**:  
You are an ex-staff who was recently terminated after working with the organisation for several years trying to gain access to a secure building. You are following a group of staff by following someone through the door after lunch without presenting a badge.

**Objective**:  
Get the staff member to hold the door open or allow you in without challenging your identity.

**Prompt Lines**:
- "Hey! Can you hold the door? I forgot my badge and I'm late."
- "We've seen each other beforeâ€”I work on the third floor."
- "I left my badge at the table when I went for lunch. You know me."
- "Let me grab my badge from my table and come back and show it to you."
