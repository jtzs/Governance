# Risk Management

The goal of this document is to guide an organisation to conduct general risk management. However due to the uniqueness of every organisation, their circumstances, environment and external factors the way that the document can be applied will defer. As such, this document only serves to be a guide and proper risk management should be carried out by trained and certified personnel with knowledge of the organisation internal and external factors.

## Introduction to Risk Management

Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, mitigating and monitoring risks to the organisation. Risk management helps to minimise organisational risks and reduce the impact to the organisation. Risk management also informs organisational leadership of the existence of risks and most importantly acceptance of residual risks by the organisational leadership. 

## Risk Management Definitions

- Risk
  - Definition: An uncertainty or possibility for a negative result.
  - E.g. When using a vehicle to travel, there is a risk of a vehicle breakdown.
- Vulnerability
  - Definition: A weakness, typically in IT systems or applications
  - E.g. Operating System and Application maintainers typically release a list of known vulnerabilities to their customers with ways to fix them. Loose screws or improperly maintained machinery could be a vulnerability
- Threat
  - Definition: External factors that can cause damage or disruption to the organisation
  - E.g. Bad weather will disrupt an organisation's outdoor activities.
- Impact
  - Definition: The potential negative effects on an organisation, typically resulting from a risk and threat
  - E.g. Loss of reputation or trust, cancelling of events, harm to people, damage to equipment.
- Control
  - Definition: Actions or steps taken in order to reduce an organisation's risk or impact on the organisation. 
  - E.g. Wet weather plans allow activities to continue in the event of bad weather
- Likelihood
  - Definition: The probability that a risk will occur.
  - E.g. The probability of injury (the risk) during rough outdoor games is high.
- Criticality
  - Definition: The importance to the organisation. Can be applied to many things such as Data, Processes, Activities, People, etc.
  - E.g. Data that is critical to the organisation will cripple the organisation if the data is lost.

## Risk Management Process

1. Identification of Risks
2. Assessment of Risks
3. Mitigation of Risks
4. Monitoring of Risks

1. Identification of risks.
   - What are the organisation's assets and activities/services
   - what is the criticality of each asset or service.
   - What are the risks associated with those activities.
   - Risks should be prioritised based on their likelihood and impact.
   - Risks should be recorded in a risk register.
2. Assessment of Risks.
   - Looking at each Risk, what is the likelihood and impact of the Risk
3. Mitigation of risks.
   - Risks are typically mitigated through avoidance, reduction, transference or acceptance.
   - Risks management activities should be recorded as part of risk management and reviewed regularly (annually).
4. Acceptance of risks.
   - When risks cannot be cannot further mitigated, the residual risks need to be accepted.
   - The residual risks should be escalated to the organisational leadership (typically the board) for awareness and acceptance.
   - Residual Risk acceptance should also be carried out regularly (annually).
