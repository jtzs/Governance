# ðŸŽ­ Security Awareness Role-Play Scenarios

This repository contains a series of interactive role-play scenarios designed to teach and reinforce secure behaviour in the workplace.

Each scenario includes:

- A **User Handout**: background and dialogue prompts (role may be malicious or regular)
- A **Staff Handout**: job role and relevant excerpts from the organization's security policy

> ðŸ”’ **Key Principle**: Staff do not know if the user they are interacting with is malicious or legitimate. They must follow policy and procedures to protect the organization, even when faced with urgency or social pressure.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

1. **staff-handouts**: Contains the handouts for the staff

2. **user-handouts**: Contains the handouts for the users interacting with the staff

## ðŸš€ How to Run a Scenario

1. **Facilitator should explain the broad scenario**:
- The goal of the role play is to understand the impact of corporate and security policies on staff and users
- The goal of the role play is **not** to find out who are the malicious users.
- Participants should be paired and split into staff and users

2. **Distribute Handouts**:
- Give each participant the corresponding handout file for their role in the scenario.
- Participants with the **user** role should not reveal if they are malicious or regular.
- Instruct them to read their role description.
- Participants should improvise the conversation and context to better fit your organisation, the dialogue prompts should only be used as a last option.

3. **Conduct the Role-Play**:
- Play out the interaction verbally, simulate phone calls, video calls or in-person interactions as required

4. **Debrief**:
- Discuss what went well and what could be improved.
- Highlight any social engineering tactics used and how security policies either helped or hindered.

## âœ… Learning Objectives

- Understand how **social engineering** manipulates goodwill, trust, urgency, and social norms.
- Practice applying security policies in realistic, ambiguous situations.
- Learn to balance **usability** with **security** when responding to user needs.
