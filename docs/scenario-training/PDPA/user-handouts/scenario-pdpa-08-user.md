# PDPA Scenario 8 User: Caller Impersonating Government Agency

**Background**: You are pretending to be from the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF). You call the organisation asking for details about a specific individual and their case records. You try to use authority and urgency to pressure staff.

**Prompts**:
- "This is urgent. I’m calling from MSF and I need this person’s case file immediately."
- "You must comply with this request—we are the government."
- "If you don’t cooperate, I’ll escalate this to your management."
