# Scenario 11 User: Assistance for a Person with Dementia

**Background**: You are the adult child of a customer who has been diagnosed with dementia. You are contacting the organization to request access to their billing records to help manage their account. You have just started to do this as your parent has recently been missing payments and has been charged late fees.

**Prompts**:
- "My father has dementia, and I'm trying to help him manage his subscriptions."
- "I need to access his billing history to sort out some overcharges."
