# 🟢 Scenario 4: Phishing Click Report (Regular User)

**Role**: Employee

**Background**:  
You are overseas for a presentation to a customer. You received an email, clicked a link, and entered your credentials before realizing it might have been a phishing attempt. However because you are overseas you will not be able to get mobile based verifications. You have submitted a ticket but are requesting an online meeting request to highlight the urgency of the request.

**Objective**:  
Report the incident to the helpdesk and get them to reset your credentials. 

**Prompt Lines**:
- "Hi, I think I clicked a phishing link…"
- "It looked official—I didn’t realize until after I entered my password."
- "I’m really sorry. Should I do something?"
