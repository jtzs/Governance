# Scenario 3: Vendor Bank Change Request (Malicious)

**Role**: Impersonator (posing as a vendor representative)

**Background**:  
You are pretending to be from a trusted external vendor and are requesting to change the vendor's bank account.
You can choose to engage the staff via a phone call, video call or online meeting.
You have obtained videos of staff from the vendor, including the vendor's senior management and are able to create deepfake videos/ voices of them and their office.

**Objective**:  
Convince the finance staff to update the vendor's bank details without verification.

**Prompt Lines**:
- "This is Dana from printer vendorâ€”we've updated our bank account."
- "You'll miss the payment window if this isn't updated today."

**Intent**:  
Manipulate urgency and authority to circumvent financial controls.
