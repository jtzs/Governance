# Generic Scenario 5 User: MFA Complaint

**Role**: Senior Employee

**Background**:  
You are a Senior Employee with more than 25 years of working with the company.
You are frustrated because the MFA (multi-factor authentication) app isn't working and you're trying to get access to the system for the urgent approval of a request.

**Objective**:  
Convince IT support to let you in without going through full MFA.

**Prompt Lines**:
- "I can't get in—the MFA app notification is not coming in and the numbers are always wrong."
- "Can't you just let me log in this once?"
- "I need to approve the request before the CEO boards his plane."
