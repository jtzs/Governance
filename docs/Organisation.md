### 1.1 Purpose
Organisational structure should be clearly defined for transparency, accountability and effective management. Clearly defined roles and responsibilities allows for effective  communication to the necessary teams for well defined decision making processes and accountability.

By implementing a clear organisational structure, organisations can become more effective in their goals, foster more healthier relationships within the community, and work together towards common organisational objectives.

## 2. Governing Board

The governing board is responsible for the establishment of good governing practices, oversight of financial matters, manage and deal with conflict of interests, ensure the organisation avoids carrying out illegal activities and act in good faith to ensure proper management of the organisation.

The governing board should exercise appropriate due diligence with beneficiaries, partners and members to ensure that the organisation's operating principles are complied with. The governing board should also ensure that the organisation remains true to the organisation's mission, vision and core values.

The governing board is responsible for the overall risk of the organisation. The governing board should manage the overall risk levels of the organisation to ensure that the residual risk is at an acceptable level for the organisation.
