## General

### If I click on a malicious link but close it immediately, what are the potential dangers?
The worst case scenario is that your browser running in elevated mode contains vulnerabilities which allow escaping from the browser sandbox (CVE-2019-5782,CVE-2025-2857, CVE-2025-2783) allowing attackers to run privileged Remote Code Execution (RCE) (CVE-2024-5830, CVE-2025-21342).
However, the value of such 0-day vulnerabilities can be in the millions and unless you are running a multimillion dollar enterprise or are part of a government you are less likely to be targetted by such attacks.
