## Closing remarks

A standard is only as effective as it's implementation and successful implementations can only happen in organisations with the close cooperation of the leadership, the staff and the volunteers. The goal of this document is not to penalise but to provide the organisation direction and guidance on how bring to best protect the organisation's IT assets.
